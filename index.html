<h1>History of C#</h1>
<p>The first version of C# was developed by Microsoft between 1999 and 2002 and was officially released to the public in 2002 as a part of the .NET platform. The .NET platform aims to make software development for Windows easier by providing a new quality approach to programming, based on the concepts of the "virtual machine" and "managed code". At that time the Java language and platform reaped an enormous success in all fields of software development; C# and .NET were Microsoft’s natural response to the Java technology.</p>
	
	<h1>Advantages of C# : </h1>
	<p>C# is an object-oriented programming language. Such are all modern programming languages used for serious software systems (like Java and C++). The advantages of object-oriented programming are brought up in many passages throughout the book, but, for the moment, you can think of object-oriented languages as languages that allow working with objects from the real world for example student, school, textbook, book and others . </p>
	<p>By starting to program with C# and the .NET Framework platform, you are on a very perspective track. If you open a website with job offers for programmers, you’ll see for yourself that the demand for C# specialists is huge and is close to the demand for Java programmers. At the same time, the demand for PHP, C++ and other technology specialists is far lower than the demand for C# and Java engineers. For the good programmer, the language they use is of no significant meaning, because they know how to program. Whatever language and technology they might need, they will master it quickly. Our goal is not to teach you C#, but rather teach you programming! After you master the fundamentals of programming and learn to think algorithmically . </p>
